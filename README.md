We have designed a scheduling application called “HELIX Scheduling” that can be used to assign tasks and manage the workload for employees. The login page is the first page users will see when accessing the Helix scheduling application. It allows users to sign in with their username and password, and is designed with security in mind to protect user information. Before logging into the system, new users are prompted to register for the application (Figure 1). The register page allows new users to sign up for the Helix scheduling application (Figure 2). Users will be required to provide basic information such as their name, email address, phone number and a password. Once registered, users can log in to the application and access its various features.
 
The home page of the Helix scheduling application serves as the primary entry point for users, providing them with a comprehensive overview of the application's key features and functionality (Figure 3). Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the home page offers a sleek and intuitive interface that allows users to easily navigate to other sections of the application. In addition, the home page also contains a list of upcoming shifts that provides employees with a detailed view of their schedules for the upcoming month. This feature allows users to view their work schedules at a glance and plan their time accordingly. Another key element of the home page is the upcoming tasks section, which displays a list of tasks due for a specific employee. This feature allows employees to prioritize their work and stay on track with their assignments. 

The task page is a fundamental component of the Helix scheduling application that empowers users to manage their assigned tasks effectively (Figure 4). Through the task page, users can access a comprehensive overview of their assigned tasks, including information on task status, start and due dates, and task priority. One of the key features of the task page is the ability to assign new tasks. Admin users can create new tasks and assign them to individual team members or specific teams, enabling effective workload management and distribution. Tasks can optionally be created to repeat daily, weekly or monthy. To facilitate efficient task management, the task page includes different columns that categorize pending and archived tasks. The pending task column displays all active tasks that require attention, providing users with a clear view of their immediate priorities. The archived task column stores all completed tasks, ensuring that users can easily access a record of their previous assignments. If a user is an admin or owner of an organization there will be extra tabs for them to view the tasks assigned throughout that organization.

The schedule page is a core feature of the Helix scheduling application that enables users to manage their work schedule, appointments, and tasks with ease (Figure 5). Through the schedule page, users can access a calendar view of their upcoming responsibilities, which can be viewed by day, week, or month. One of the key benefits of the schedule page is the ability to view other workers' schedules, allowing users to plan and coordinate their activities more effectively. This feature promotes collaboration and helps to ensure that team members are aware of each other's schedules and workloads. Additionally, the schedule page enables users to request time off, providing a straightforward process for employees to take time away from work when necessary. Users can view their available vacation days, submit time-off requests, and track the status of their requests, all through the schedule page.

The availability page is a key component of the scheduling application that allows users to view and manage their availability for upcoming tasks and projects. This feature enables users to set their availability status, including the specific dates and times when they are available or unavailable to work (Figure 7). The availability page also enables users to view the availability of other team members, helping to facilitate effective project planning and resource allocation. It provides users with the ability to manage their workload efficiently and ensures that all team members are on the same page regarding their availability.

The account page is where users can view and manage their account details within the Helix scheduling application (Figure 8). Users can update their personal information, change their password, and manage their settings.

Register organization page allows users to create a new organization within the Helix scheduling application. Users will be required to provide basic information about the organization, such as its name, description, and whether it is public or private. Once created, users can invite other users to join the organization and assign tasks to them. The join organization page allows users to search for an existing organization within the Helix scheduling application and request to join it. Once a user requests to join an organization, the organization's admin user will receive a notification and can choose to accept or reject the request.

The organization page provides users with a view of the organization's details, such as its name, description, and members with their basic information. The owner of the organization can edit the basic information. The owner and admins can edit information for users specific to that organization (hourly pay, their manager and department). Admins and owners can also create new department and edit their details. The organization list is a directory of all organizations that the user iis a part of, clicking on one will bring the user to the page for the selected organization.
